#CodeSource

I plan to break this project into stages that hopefully will get more challenging and also attempt new ways to get something close to a single page app/site. 

Stages

1.Html file and content organized within table tags

2.Adding Framework to help style and layout (e.g. Bootstrap)

3.Add JS and nav tabs to make it closer to a single page app

4.Experiment with JS template engine(html templates) and ExpressJS and MongoDatabase to create a CRUD and possibly and SPA
