#CodeSource

I plan to break this project into stages that hopefully will get more challenging and also attempt new ways to get something close to a single page app/site. 

Also, each stage I tried to store it as a git tag so you can pull it by following the commands below

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ar-to/codesource.git
```

Check the tags available

```
$ git tag
```

Then to move into a tag and make it your working directory

```
$ git checkout -b [branchname] [tagname]
```

##Stages by version

### v1.0

1.Html file and content organized within table tags

2.Adding Framework to help style and layout (e.g. Bootstrap)

### v2.0

3.Add JS and nav tabs to make it closer to a single page app

4.Experiment with JS template engine(html templates) and ExpressJS and MongoDatabase to create a CRUD and possibly and SPA
